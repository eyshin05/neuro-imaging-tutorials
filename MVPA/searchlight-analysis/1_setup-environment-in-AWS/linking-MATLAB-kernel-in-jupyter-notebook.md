# Linking MATLAB kernel in a jupyter notebook
* What you need: 
  * MATLAB version 2016b or later
  * and the [MATLAB engine for python](https://kr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html).
    * The MATLAB engine for python has existed in older versions, but they only support python 3.4 or older, so they aren't compatible with the MATLAB kernel.
